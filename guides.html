      <div class="contentmain">
          <p>Since inception of the Blockchain Centralized Crypto Exchanges are dominating the crypto market and more than 95% transactions are taking place in such exchange. The objective of the Blockchain is to decentralize the world. Dexdana is here to empower the decentralized exchange. Dexdana is a decentralized exchange for ERC 20 Tokens.Dexdana use off-chain order book with On-chain settlement.</p>

      <h2 id="#fees">How gas (transaction) fees work:</h2>
      <div class="contentmain">
          <p>Every Ethereum transaction involves a gas fee which is paid to miners on the Ethereum network. On Dexdana, Ethereum transactions are required for depositing, withdrawing, and trading.</p>
          <p>If you're using Dexdana with MetaMask, you can lower the gas price when you accept a transaction to pay a lower gas fee. We recommend a gas fee of 4 gwei if you don't mind waiting a few blocks for your transaction to confirm. If you're using Dexdana without MetaMask, the gas price is fixed at 4 gwei.</p>
          <p>If you're not using MetaMask, you can set the gas price from the "Gas price" item in the account dropdown (upper right).</p>
          <p>Without getting into too much technical detail, a 4 gwei gas price corresponds to the following overall transaction fees:</p>

          <p>An important feature of Dexdana is that placing an order doesn't involve an Ethereum transaction. Placing an order involves signing a message, which doesn't cost a gas fee. This means that placing an order on Dexdana is completely free: there's no Ethereum transaction fee and there's no fee if the order trades. The one and only platform fee Dexdana charges is a 0.3% fee paid by the person executing an order (paid in the instrument being sold).</p>

      <h2>How to deposit, withdraw, and transfer:</h2>
      <div class="contentmain">
        <div class="subtitle">Deposit:</div>
            <p>Select an account in the account dropdown which is at the upper right. Your account should be managed by either MetaMask or Dexdana browser wallet. You can see you wallet balance next to your account address. If zero balance in the wallet then you need to send some ETH to your wallet address. Do that before proceeding to the next step.</p>
            <p>Now some ETH in your wallet, deposit ether from your wallet to the Dexdana smart contract so that you can start trading. In the upper left, you can see balance section. There are three columns, “deposit”, “withdraw” and “transfer.” The “deposit” column shows the balance held in the account you have selected in the account dropdown.</p>
            <p>
            When you deposit fund then it moves from your “wallet” to the Dexdana exchange smart contract. To do this enter the amount and click “deposit.” Make sure that you are not depositing all of your Ethereum; keep some Ethereum to cover gas fees. Generally leaving 0.05 ETH in the wallet considers good and it covers gas fee for future transactions (trading, depositing, and withdrawing.)
            </p>
            <p>In case if you are using MetaMask, then transaction approval takes some time. If you are not using MetaMask, you can set the gas price from the “Gas price” item in the account dropdown, which is located at the upper right.</p>
            
            <div class="subtitle">NOTE:</div>
            <p>In case if you are depositing a token (not ETH), then you have to do two consecutive transactions. The first transactions will approve the Dexdana smart contract to transfer the deposit on your behalf and the second will be the actual deposit. It is mandatory to approve the both.</p>
            <p>After confirmation Dexdana will tell you that you generated a transaction. You can click on the provided link to track your transaction.</p>
            
            <div class="subtitle">Withdraw: </div>
            <p>The Withdraw tab is the opposite of the Deposit tab. It will move funds from the "Dexdana" column back to the "Wallet" column.</p>
            
             <div class="subtitle">Transfer:  </div>
            <p>If you want to transfer funds to another address, then there is transfer tab next to the withdraw tab at the upper left. The deposit tab moves funds from your wallet to Dexdana. The withdraw tab moves funds from Dexdana to your wallet. The transfer tab moves funds from your wallet to another wallet address.</p>
            <p>On the transfer tab, the first box is the amount which you want to transfer and the second box is the address you want to transfer to. Although, the address you want to transfer to is pre-filled in with your existing address. In case if you want to change the address then remove this address, enter the address of your choice and then click on transfer.</p>

      <h2>How to trade on Dexdana? </h2>
      <div class="contentmain">
        <div class="subtitle">How to execute a trade? </div>
        <ul>	
            <li>Pick a token to trade. This guide will assume you have chosen PLU.</li>
            <li>Most tokens are listed in term of ETH. For example, a price of 0.03 PLU/ ETH means 1 PLU costs 0.03 ETH.</li>
            <li>In the order book you can see the green orders and red orders stacked on top of each other. Green orders are people who want to buy PLU and red orders are people who want to sell PLU. Click on red order to buy PLU, and click on green order to sell PLU.</li>
            <li>Dexdana will allow you to match one order per transaction.</li>
            <li>Partial fills are allowed. For example, if sell order is 100PLU then you can click the order and choose to trade only 25 PLU, leaving 75 PLU behind for someone else to trade.</li>
            <li>When you do a trade transaction will be generated.</li>
            <li>In case, if more than one people try to trade the same order at once, the first transaction to be confirmed will get the trade.</li>
            <li>You will get error in case of failed trade, but your fund will remain safe. Only a gas charges will be deducted.</li>
        </ul>
            
    <div class="subtitle">How to place an order? </div>
        <ul>
            <li>You are free to place your own order, in case if you don’t want to trade immediately or don’t like the price you see in the order book.</li>
            <li>An order doesn’t involve a transaction. Here you have to sign a message, this mean there is no gas fee for placing orders.</li>
            <li>If you want to buy or sell the token then select the buy tab or sell tab on the order form.</li>
            <li>Let’s assume you want to buy a token.</li>
            <li>The first box is the amount of token, which you want to buy.</li>
            <li>The second box is the token price.</li>
            <li>The third box is the amount of token you will spend. The box will populate automatically so you can confirm that the price you entered make sense.</li>
            <li>The fourth box is the number of Ethereum blocks until your order expires automatically. The default, 10,000 is about two days.</li>
            <li>After submitting the order, you will see two small green bubbles pop up in the lower right. The first bubble is the indication of “you sent an order” and the second bubble is the indication of “ your order was received”</li>
            <li>You can see your order in the order book right after your order was received.</li>
            <li>Your order will be highlighted in blue, so you can spot it easily.</li>
            <li>The order book will only show top 100 buy and sell order. If your order is not in top 100 then it will not display, but it will appear if enough orders trade.</li>
            <li>Dexdana does not do order matching. For example, if someone is offering token for sale at 0.03, you can place an order to buy for a price of 0.04, trading is not automatic. If you wish to trade then click an order and trade.</li>
            <li>The balance will not change when you place an order, balance will change when you trade an order.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="subtitle">How to cancel an order: </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on order tab, which is under “ My Transaction”</li>
            <li>Find your order in the order list and then press cancel.</li>
            <li>This will trigger a transaction.  </li>
